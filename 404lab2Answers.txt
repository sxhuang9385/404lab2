1. Use the socket library and use socket.AF_INET and socket.SOCK_STREAM for the address family and type for the server.

2. a client socket connects to an address and port number
   a server socket binds to an address and port.

3. socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, value)
   The socket.SO_REUSEADDR argument tells the kernal to reuse a socket

4. AF_INET shows the address family and SOCK_STREAM shows the socket type

5. recv() returns the bytes object of the data received. The max size is specified by the argument, ie recv(123) has a bufsize of 123.
